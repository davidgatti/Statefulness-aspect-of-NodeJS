# First off

Thank you for considering contributing to this project ðŸ˜€. All my project have one goal, to teach how to write simpler, easier to understand code to the point that a non technical person will understand it. For example:

- The way I write my comments is on purpose, because I found that this way is the easiest way for a brain to filter out and understand
- In JavaScript code I just use `let` instead of `const` so no one will get confused, I want people to focus on the article or example, instead of why I used `let` here, and `const` there. 
- On purpose I use as little variables as possible to yet again, not confuse anybody. 

# What I believe in

- Making everything simpler for everyone to understand. 
- Frameworks force you to be organized, instead of teaching you how to be organized.

# Childish Code

A way to say that code should be understood even by a child. Write simple to understand code. Don't make it obscure, and be the only one that can understand it. Be mindful of other people, and their time.
