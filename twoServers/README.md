# Two-Server Example

This is another cool example that showcase what can you do with the stateful aspect of NodeJS. This example shows that you can access the same array from two different server instances running on two different ports.

The GIF above shows these two servers accessing the same variable. The server on the left is being refreshed every second. The right one is refreshed every five seconds.

I donâ€™t know about you, but I think this is super cool. But I have no idea of a practical use case ðŸ˜„.
